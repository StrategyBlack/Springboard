1. Song Hit Prediction

Problem: A music recording label receives thousands of submissions by artists who are looking to be signed or sell their song
to be performed by artists who are already in the industry. Reviewers working at these recording companies must determine which 
which artists and/or songs to invest in based on the expected potential of the song being released on the market. While tools do
exist to assist reviewers with this task, the process remains primarily manual.

Solution: Build a model to predict the success of a song release based on song characteristics (e.g. genre, harmonic progression,
structure, loudness, tempo, meter, complexity, syncopation, repitition, mood, etc). The model would be used by reviewers
to filter the selection of candidate songs and boost ROI for songs the music label releases.

Data: The data will be sourced from UCI Machine Learning Repository and will include approximately half-a-million records with 90 
song variables. Since this data was gathered to be used for a different purpose, additional sources of data will be required to 
append a song-success dependent variable needed for this project. As time permits, other data sources will be explored and added
if they improve the predictive power of the model.
